    <h1>I HATE SPRINTING</h1>
    <br><br>
    We're working hard to make sure the game comes out next week, although it's scary, it's not done, but there's 16
    endings and we got 12 of em done. I'm mainly worried about other features like the outfits and the items you're
    supposed to get from every ending (since I haven't made any of them yet, they aren't exactly used. Although yes,
    they will be used in the finale.)
    <br><br>
    Other than that, I think we need to enter the bug testing phase, so that we don't pull a Sonic Origins, or a Sonic
    Frontiers, or a Sonic Superstars, or a Sonic Colors Ultimate...
    <br><br>
    Speaking of bugs, THE RUNNING STOPPED FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY
    I was able to fix most of it, but as a person who has trouble scripting stuff like that, I dunno why it doesn't
    work, it annoys me.
    This is exactly why I didn't put sprinting in the first game, cuz its annoying ðŸ« 
    <br><br>
    Hopefully we can fix this... soon, because the game requires sprinting.
    <br><br>
    That's all for today, take this picture of Muffin Man chugging down some Milk Man Milk
