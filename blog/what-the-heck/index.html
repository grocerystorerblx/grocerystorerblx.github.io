    <h1>What the heck happened!?!?</h1>
    <h2> So... where have we been? Its been forever! Well, I'll answer that.
      <br>
      We're still working on the game! Just.. really..... slooowwwllyyyy.... We also have another project in the works,
      hoping you guys will like it, and get Grocery Store back on it's feet! A big problem that we've seemed to have is
      that Grocery Store 2, though it's a better game, didn't reach as far as the first game did, which sucks. We're
      hoping we can get more people interested while working on the finale! We also have had a mini update planned, but
      as progress has been going unusually slow, it kind of sucks. One big downside is that I'm not the best coder, and
      I've been putting lots of work into trying to learn more, though I don't seem to get anywhere, which is extremely
      demotivating to see, and doesn't help progress. Though, for this to all come out, I need you guys to bear with me
      here. I've made this painting of PL4YR and his consistent nightmares about H4CKR he had the entire week that
      occured between Grocery Store 1 and Grocery Store 2.
