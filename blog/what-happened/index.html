    <h1>What... Happened?</h1>
    <h2>I don't and didn't really want to say anything too personal, but I feel like I have to say something, because I
      feel very disappointed in myself for not delivering anything to you guys. <br>If you don't want to see my yap
      session, skip to the third paragraph.<br><br>I went on break because I've been facing lots and lots of stress. I
      don't exactly know where it came from, and I don't know how to make it go away. The best ive gathered is that
      stress is preventing me from doing almost anything for some reason, even things like drawing when those are
      supposed to be stress relieving activities. This stress is also paired up with me possibly having Autism and or
      ADHD. Which is highly likely, considering the mannerisms and the way I act, but I have always been and will
      probably stay untested and therefore undiagnosed. I'm unsure if I will ever find out. But the stress paired with
      the mental challenges that were already present have created a vortex of emotion swirling inside of me. I end up
      taking projects very big (AND STILL POSSIBLE) but due to me having trouble being able to stay on one at a time and
      the newly found problem of me just not being able to work on anything, it makes work basically impossible
      nowadays. All of this paired with the fact that I was already starting to doubt myself because of my inability to
      finish The Finale amongst other things due to my very very bad job at scripting, did not help anything. So I just
      stopped. But I still want to make it.<br><br>So what about Grocery Store?<br>It's not cancelled. As much as that
      would be stress RELIEVING, its not the right thing nor is it what I want to do. In my mind I have crafted what I
      believe to be one of my most beautiful stories that the team is helping me edit and bring to life. You already
      know we're taking on many things like Grocery Store 2: Finale, Grocery Store: Tower Defense, Grocery Store: After
      Hours, and Grocery Store Restocked. You don't have to worry about this. Grocery Store: Tower Defense is mainly
      being developed and overseen by our builder, character designer, UI editor, K1ng_Bac0n, who is the person who
      pitched this game to me and seemed excited and motivated to take it on. Grocery Store Restocked is simply a
      reimagining of the initial game, as the first game makes me unhappy to see and even unhappier that it is required
      to play to fully understand the Grocery Store timeline Restocked should not take long, as we are not fully
      replacing the assets, but just re-scripting everything already there with a better engine, the After Hours engine,
      which brings us to Grocery Store: After Hours. Being developed by me and Catshee mainly, should not take that long
      either, as it will use the same reimagined map as Grocery Store 1, and same characters + maybe a few new ones.
      This game also will not be crazy with drama and tension, as it simply follows the the night after GS1, where PL4YR
      could not sleep due to his survivor's guilt and traumatic experience. <br><br>As for the Grocery Store 2: Finale
      Part 1. It is still coming, and it is not exactly being worked on every day, but we are still working. We have
      been stuck trying to script a boss battle. The main problem, and I'll be blunt with it, is that I can't script
      those. I'm trying to figure out what to do and learn (since to be frank, I don't know what to do)<br>Other things
      I want to add with the finale will be roleplay servers, arcade modes for you to replay your favorite minigames,
      updated endings with more action, fun, spice, fairness, overall something more engaging, and lastly, hugely
      updated graphics to make the game look nice and amazing.<br><br>I hope you guys are still looking forward to
      everything Grocery Store related that has yet to come out. Me and the team are working so hard to bring all this
      Grocery Store content to you guys. You just need to have patience, as I just need motivation.<br>The image for
      this devlog post will be my friend Crow, who I am playing Arcane Odyssey with as I type this. I took this picture
      because they acclaim they use fire magic, but you see, I think they REALLY use explosion magic. Do you guys
      believe me, or Crow?<br><br>Thanks for reading, Remember to Reach For The Stars, and I'll catch you guys next
      time.<br>-Ray</h2>
