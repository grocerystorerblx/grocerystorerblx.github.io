      So, progress update, I'm trying to pick up the game again because, good news, the team has a release date in mind.
      and I'm trying to get... things done by Rayday!
      <br>
      <br>
      Bad news, I can't.. update the game?
      I can't say much about this; this is a really big secret, but as you know, a requested feature of GS1 had lots to
      do with save data and resetting said data, so in that case, I've been working with lots of data, and one VERY BIG
      datastore thingy, and I noticed it's not saving, this is because due to the game's takedown (which I know the
      reason of, just hadn't fixed yet due to personal reasons) I cannot save most of the progress and stuff (Which may
      be wrong because yesterday I saved and the stuff I made yesterday I was able to open today. However, nonetheless,
      I cannot get my save data from the datastores.)
      <br>
      <br>
      So that will halt progress for a little bit. However, I am now focusing on the main game, as I said, I need to get
      a good amount done By Rayday so expect something there. I'm definitely going to get a good amount of endings done
      (and then after that work on the shop system)
      <br>
      <br>
      I have decided I will save datastores for last, due to the fact that when I get every ending done, THEN I will
      know the amount of data I need to save for this new progress saving system.
      <br>
      <br>
      Currently, I have emailed Roblox about the changes to GS2 that I made to HOPEFULLY get the game back up now, it
      worked for GSR.
      <br>
      <br>
      By the way, if you didn't know, Rayday is my birthday lol, and it's on September 10th.
      <br>
      <br>
      So yeah, hope to see you Rayday! ðŸ’«
