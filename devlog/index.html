      <h1>Failure...</h1>
      <h2>I tried to get to work, I started with trying to model a fish for an ending, my journey of modeling said fish is on my Twitter page
        <br>
        I give up till tomorrow, I'm busy and have stuff to do, and this fish is frustrating me, so not much got done today on my end.
        <br>
        Catshee  has been working on the ending I was trying to model the fish for, so that's good, otherwise not much for today.
        <br>
        Also TheDurbie is working on an official Grocery Store website for me to put devlog updates and cool stuff on in the future, so watch out for that, and if that website does come, devlogs will most likely be on a weekly schedule instead of just whenever we work on the game.
        For today's picture, take a picture that everyone asking about H4CKR surely needs</h2>

      <h1>Lazy Days.. or I guess weeks?</h1>
      <h2>We didn't do too much this week, I changed a lot of decorative stuff, but other than that our good ol pal @Cats handled the scripting
          The game officially has to release in a bit less than a month, so hopefully we can get this down...
          Idk why, I haven't had the drive or energy to work too much recently, so that sucks.
          However, since I feel too lazy to really go into studio or blender and work on stuff asset-wise, I've been doing a few things.. 
          It's a surprise though, if we even decide to add it to the game (I hope we'd do but we'd need someone with a good deep enough voice.... unless I can try and do it lols)

      <h2>Wow, we got a month left to release this game! We've been making well.. somewhat good progress. We're trying to get done (or start) at least one ending every day!

          We got the area built for this next ending, which will hopefully be a chill relaxing one!

      <h1>Putting my Rayussy into this</h1>
      <h2>I didn't work on GS2 for a hot minute because of personal stuff, but Sonic Frontiers DLC made me feel inspired to work some more! I really wanna finish this game! Luckily, however, while I was slackin off, talented developer Catshee really stepped up and helped work on an ending! Ending is basically done but I'm working out a few things before eventually it will be finished finished.
          <br>
          <br>
          As for now, I'm 3D modeling for GS2 (wow..)
          Trying to put lots of effort into this game so that it comes out the best game it can be. I'm super excited for you guys to see what we've been working on, and the fact that I'm now 3D modeling for this game right now feels kinda insane!
          Excited for you guys to see what's planned, here's a pic of what I'm modeling!
          Are you able to figure out what it is? It's fairly easy. Either way, I'm not answering, so don't ask!

      <h1>Braindead</h1>
      <h2>ok so I was too tired last night because the entirety of the game broke and I had a full-on mental breakdown but it's all fixed now, so I got to finish another ending, however since I was mentally drained the ending is very... wacky.. zany.. a bit weird in the head.. but it's still a fun ending, it also sucked though because my files kept crashing, settings kept crashing, snip and sketch wasn't working, so my PC was just not having a good time, but I still managed to work.
          <br>
          Anyways take this picture that's tooootally not related to the ending

          I'm gonna try and get another ending done even though I only have about 37 minutes left to be awake.

      <h1>Store stuff at the store store...</h1>
      <h2>Good news, I finished the main store system for GS2! I say the main shop system because I think GS2 is going to have three main shops, but every shop is mainly going to be different, so that's why it is the main shop system. 
          <br>
          <br>
          With that, I also finished another ending (and as I guess you could just check my profile to see so what would be the point of hiding it?) aka the shoplifting ending! No further comment on said ending though.
          <br>
          <br>
          Trying to get enough progress done, as I've said before, special things are happening on September 10th, aka Rayday. So stay tuned.

      <h1>Life is.. roadblocks...</h1>
      <h2>(I am so sorry for this title)
          <br>
          <br>
          So, progress update, I'm trying to pick up the game again because, good news, the team has a release date in mind. and I'm trying to get... things done by Rayday!
          <br>
          <br>
          Bad news, I can't.. update the game?
          I can't say much about this; this is a really big secret, but as you know, a requested feature of GS1 had lots to do with save data and resetting said data, so in that case, I've been working with lots of data, and one VERY BIG datastore thingy, and I noticed it's not saving, this is because due to the game's takedown (which I know the reason of, just hadn't fixed yet due to personal reasons) I cannot save most of the progress and stuff (Which may be wrong because yesterday I saved and the stuff I made yesterday I was able to open today. However, nonetheless, I cannot get my save data from the datastores.) 
          <br>
          <br>
          So that will halt progress for a little bit. However, I am now focusing on the main game, as I said, I need to get a good amount done By Rayday so expect something there. I'm definitely going to get a good amount of endings done (and then after that work on the shop system)
          <br>
          <br>
          I have decided I will save datastores for last, due to the fact that when I get every ending done, THEN I will know the amount of data I need to save for this new progress saving system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Currently, I have emailed Roblox about the changes to GS2 that I made to HOPEFULLY get the game back up now, it worked for GSR.
          <br>
          <br>
          By the way, if you didn't know, Rayday is my birthday lol, and it's on September 10th. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So yeah, hope to see you Rayday! ðŸ’«

      <h1>Wowee Golly Gee Whiz! Datastores?</h1>
      <h2>We all know that the first Grocery Store had.. no datastores, which meant that things weren't really resettable, you couldn't restart, everything was basically hard-locked in! This time, we have actual datastores!! You can restart your progress as many times as you want! Something also coming in the game? Collectibles! I've always wanted collectibles in a game, I'm super excited for you guys to see the items I want you guys to collect! I don't wanna give too much info away now, but I will say there are 8 collectible grocery bags around the game.. so go get 'em!
          <br>
          Now, for this announcement, take this picture of PL4YR being surrounded by a bunch of grocery bags :P

      <h1>First GS2 Devlog post</h1>
      <h2>Me and Jax are working on the music together!
          <br>
          <br>
          There's songs lead by me, and then songs lead by Jax. Songs lead by me I start and try my best to make, as I'm still a beginner composer, where Jax then helps clean it up and make it better. Songs lead by Jax are ones that I give him a basic melody and idea for and he makes them. The first song (A Jax lead one) is very exciting and upbeat, and it's a remake/remix of a song from the first game! so I'm excited for you to hear it (and I'll probably use it for a GS2 trailer one day since the song is so good)
          The second song (lead by me) is a more literal remix of a song from the first game, which is now lo-fi and chill.
          I hope all of you are excited to hear the soundtrack, and remember to keep on store-storing your store storers!
