    <h1>What the heck happened!?!?</h1>
    <h2> So... where have we been? Its been forever! Well, I'll answer that.
        <br>
        We're still working on the game! Just.. really..... slooowwwllyyyy.... We also have another project in the works, hoping you guys will like it, and get Grocery Store back on it's feet! A big problem that we've seemed to have is that Grocery Store 2, though it's a better game, didn't reach as far as the first game did, which sucks. We're hoping we can get more people interested while working on the finale! We also have had a mini update planned, but as progress has been going unusually slow, it kind of sucks. One big downside is that I'm not the best coder, and I've been putting lots of work into trying to learn more, though I don't seem to get anywhere, which is extremely demotivating to see, and doesn't help progress. Though, for this to all come out, I need you guys to bear with me here. I've made this painting of PL4YR and his consistent nightmares about H4CKR he had the entire week that occured between Grocery Store 1 and Grocery Store 2.

      <h2>So far, today, I've been trying to get progress done, as the game comes out in under a week. I've got some things done, but really not too much at all.
        <br><br>
        Hoping to get an ending, and something that well.. technically is not much of an ending, done! It shouldn't be too much work, but I've really been procrastinating.
        <br><br>
        Though I did put some essential base game features, so I think that's pretty cool.
        <br><br>
        It's known that I'm (almost) the only animator, Cheesy animates some of what he works on, but other that I animate basically everything, so I hope you guys enjoy my animations in the game, animating is my passion, so I just hope that I've done well!

      <h1>I HATE SPRINTING</h1>
      <h2>So, I wasn't sure wether to make another announcement on here or not, mainly because I've been waiting for the website, and I wanted to atleast announce stuff before the game's release
        <br><br>
        We're working hard to make sure the game comes out next week, although it's scary, it's not done, but there's 16 endings and we got 12 of em done. I'm mainly worried about other features like the outfits and the items you're supposed to get from every ending (since I haven't made any of them yet, they aren't exactly used. Although yes, they will be used in the finale.)
        <br><br>
        Other than that, I think we need to enter the bug testing phase, so that we don't pull a Sonic Origins, or a Sonic Frontiers, or a Sonic Superstars, or a Sonic Colors Ultimate...
        <br><br>
        Speaking of bugs, THE RUNNING STOPPED FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY
        I was able to fix most of it, but as a person who has trouble scripting stuff like that, I dunno why it doesn't work, it annoys me.
        This is exactly why I didn't put sprinting in the first game, cuz its annoying ðŸ« 
        <br><br>
        Hopefully we can fix this... soon, because the game requires sprinting.
        <br><br>

        I give up till tomorrow, I'm busy and have stuff to do, and this fish is frustrating me, so not much got done today on my end.
        <br>
        Catshee  has been working on the ending I was trying to model the fish for, so that's good, otherwise not much for today.
        <br>
        Also TheDurbie is working on an official Grocery Store website for me to put devlog updates and cool stuff on in the future, so watch out for that, and if that website does come, devlogs will most likely be on a weekly schedule instead of just whenever we work on the game.

          Idk why, I haven't had the drive or energy to work too much recently, so that sucks.
          However, since I feel too lazy to really go into studio or blender and work on stuff asset-wise, I've been doing a few things.. 
          It's a surprise though, if we even decide to add it to the game (I hope we'd do but we'd need someone with a good deep enough voice.... unless I can try and do it lols)

      <h2>I didn't work on GS2 for a hot minute because of personal stuff, but Sonic Frontiers DLC made me feel inspired to work some more! I really wanna finish this game! Luckily, however, while I was slackin off, talented developer Catshee really stepped up and helped work on an ending! Ending is basically done but I'm working out a few things before eventually it will be finished finished.
          <br>
          <br>
          As for now, I'm 3D modeling for GS2 (wow..)
          Trying to put lots of effort into this game so that it comes out the best game it can be. I'm super excited for you guys to see what we've been working on, and the fact that I'm now 3D modeling for this game right now feels kinda insane!
          Excited for you guys to see what's planned, here's a pic of what I'm modeling!
          Are you able to figure out what it is? It's fairly easy. Either way, I'm not answering, so don't ask!

      <h1>Life is.. roadblocks...</h1>
      <h2>(I am so sorry for this title)
          <br>
          <br>
          So, progress update, I'm trying to pick up the game again because, good news, the team has a release date in mind. and I'm trying to get... things done by Rayday!
          <br>
          <br>
          Bad news, I can't.. update the game?
          I can't say much about this; this is a really big secret, but as you know, a requested feature of GS1 had lots to do with save data and resetting said data, so in that case, I've been working with lots of data, and one VERY BIG datastore thingy, and I noticed it's not saving, this is because due to the game's takedown (which I know the reason of, just hadn't fixed yet due to personal reasons) I cannot save most of the progress and stuff (Which may be wrong because yesterday I saved and the stuff I made yesterday I was able to open today. However, nonetheless, I cannot get my save data from the datastores.) 
          <br>
          <br>
          So that will halt progress for a little bit. However, I am now focusing on the main game, as I said, I need to get a good amount done By Rayday so expect something there. I'm definitely going to get a good amount of endings done (and then after that work on the shop system)
          <br>
          <br>
          I have decided I will save datastores for last, due to the fact that when I get every ending done, THEN I will know the amount of data I need to save for this new progress saving system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Currently, I have emailed Roblox about the changes to GS2 that I made to HOPEFULLY get the game back up now, it worked for GSR.
          <br>
          <br>
          By the way, if you didn't know, Rayday is my birthday lol, and it's on September 10th. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So yeah, hope to see you Rayday! ðŸ’«

          There's songs lead by me, and then songs lead by Jax. Songs lead by me I start and try my best to make, as I'm still a beginner composer, where Jax then helps clean it up and make it better. Songs lead by Jax are ones that I give him a basic melody and idea for and he makes them. The first song (A Jax lead one) is very exciting and upbeat, and it's a remake/remix of a song from the first game! so I'm excited for you to hear it (and I'll probably use it for a GS2 trailer one day since the song is so good)
          The second song (lead by me) is a more literal remix of a song from the first game, which is now lo-fi and chill.
          I hope all of you are excited to hear the soundtrack, and remember to keep on store-storing your store storers!
